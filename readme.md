This project is to put all of the basic commands covered into use to create a recipe page. So far what has been covered is the basic stuff that all webpages have:
The doctype- html
The head- which includes:
	The charset- utf-8 which allows special characters to be "read" by the browser
	The title - <title> which names the webpage
The body- which includes:
	The heading: <h1> to <h6> depending on the size/importance of the heading
	Paragraphs: <p> nothing will show as a paragraph unless this command is used.
	Bold text: <strong> adds importance and makes text bold
	Italics: <em> adds emphasis and makes text italic
Links- 2 types:
	relative (link to a page on the same site with a file path) 
	absolute (a link that always contains http://)
	you need <a href"website.name.or.file.path">link</a>
Images- <img src="image.url.or.file.path"> alt"description of pic" for text readers
Lists- 2 types:
	ordered <ol> - has numbers
	unordered <ul> - no numbers
	To add an item to the list use <li>list item</li>

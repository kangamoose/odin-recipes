    <p>The mild pumpkin flavour adds a little thanksgiving to this traditional chocolate treat</p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 cup roughly chopped semisweet chocolate</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl add flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt. Whisk until evenly mixed.</li>
        <li>Add in oil, vanilla. Stir until all the batter is just moistened. It should resemble sand.</li>
        <li>Stir in pumpkin. Mix with a large spatula until the batter becomes smooth. The batter will be quite thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1/2 cup of chopped chocolate. Pour batter into prepared baking pan. Use spatula to spread batter evenly across pan and smooth surface.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining chocolate across surface of the batter. Bake for 28-30 minutes. Toothpick insert should have a few crumbs clinging and the batter should no longer be liquid inside. Allow brownies to cool for one hour so that they can set before cutting and serving. If you try to cut them right away, the crumb will still be loose and it will be hard to cut the brownies without them falling apart.</li>
    </ol>
